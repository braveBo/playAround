This application uses the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture pattern with Android Architecture Components such as ViewModel and LiveData to handle data and UI updates in a reactive manner. The app also uses a Singleton ViewModel that contains a cacheList to share data between the MainActivity and MapActivity. The app uses Google Maps API to display the locations of food trucks on a map and allows the user to select a food truck marker to view more information about the food truck. The app also uses a BottomSheetDialogFragment to display detailed information about the selected food truck.

If building a full-scale production application for the Google Play Store, I would consider implementing additional features such as a search bar to search for specific food trucks, filters to narrow down food trucks based on cuisine or location, and the ability for users to save their favorite food trucks. I would also consider implementing more robust error handling and adding more tests to ensure the reliability and stability of the app. Additionally, I would focus on optimizing the app's performance to ensure it runs smoothly and efficiently on a variety of devices.
